# Battery Conservation Mode Implementation Summary ✅

## 🎯 Feature Overview
The Battery Conservation Mode has been successfully implemented in MD Shaving Solution V2. This feature automatically reduces shaving targets when SOC drops below 50% to preserve battery life.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. **UI Toggle Control** ✅
**Location**: Between simulation setup and execution (before "📊 Battery Operation Simulation")
**File**: `md_shaving_solution_v2.py` lines 2601-2616

```python
conservation_enabled = st.checkbox(
    "Enable Battery Conservation Mode", 
    value=False,
    key="v2_conservation_mode",
    help="When enabled and SOC drops below 50%, system locks in a reduced target based on minimum exceedance observed so far"
)
```

### 2. **Core Logic Implementation** ✅
**Location**: `_simulate_battery_operation_v2()` function
**File**: `md_shaving_solution_v2.py` lines 5350+ 

#### Key Features:
- **Running Minimum Tracking**: Continuously tracks the minimum exceedance observed
- **SOC Threshold**: Activates when SOC < 50%
- **Target Revision**: Locks in `revised_target = monthly_target + running_min_exceedance`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Default OFF, no behavior change when disabled

### 3. **Diagnostic Columns** ✅
**Location**: Enhanced battery table function
**File**: `md_shaving_solution_v2.py` lines 6308-6318

#### New Columns Added:
- `Conserve_Activated`: Shows "🔋 ACTIVE" or "⚪ Normal"
- `Battery Conserved kW`: Displays running minimum exceedance
- `Revised_Target_kW`: Shows the active target (original or revised)

### 4. **Results Display** ✅
**Location**: After simulation metrics
**File**: `md_shaving_solution_v2.py` lines 2667-2698

#### Conservation Metrics:
- **Conservation Periods**: Number of intervals where conservation was active
- **Conservation Rate**: Percentage of time conservation mode was active  
- **Min Exceedance Observed**: The minimum exceedance that was locked in

## 🔄 How It Works

### Normal Operation (Conservation OFF):
1. System uses original monthly targets
2. Battery discharges to keep demand at/above monthly target
3. No target modifications regardless of SOC

### Conservation Mode (Conservation ON):
1. **Tracking Phase**: System tracks running minimum exceedance
2. **Activation Phase**: When SOC < 50%, conservation activates
3. **Protection Phase**: Target becomes `monthly_target + min_exceedance_observed`
4. **Preservation**: Reduced discharge protects battery from deep discharge

## 📊 Visual Feedback

### UI Status Messages:
- **🛡️ Conservation Mode Active**: Shows when enabled
- **🔄 Normal Mode**: Shows when disabled
- **📊 Tracking**: Explains diagnostic columns

### Results Display:
- **Conservation Periods**: How many times it activated
- **Conservation Rate**: What percentage of time it was active
- **Min Exceedance**: The safety margin that was locked in

## 🧪 Testing Status

### ✅ Verified Working:
- Function imports successfully
- Conservation parameter is passed correctly
- Simulation runs with both enabled/disabled states
- Conservation columns are added to results
- UI toggle controls simulation behavior

### 🎯 Key Benefits:
1. **Battery Protection**: Prevents excessive discharge during low SOC
2. **Adaptive Targets**: Uses observed minimum exceedance for realistic targets
3. **Transparent Operation**: Clear diagnostic columns show conservation status
4. **Full Compatibility**: Works with existing V2 features and workflows

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Function Signature Update:
```python
def _simulate_battery_operation_v2(df, power_col, monthly_targets, battery_sizing, 
                                 battery_params, interval_hours, selected_tariff=None, 
                                 holidays=None, conservation_enabled=False):
```

### Core Conservation Logic:
```python
# Track running minimum exceedance
if excess > 0:
    running_min_exceedance[i] = min(running_min_exceedance[i-1], excess)

# Activate conservation when SOC < 50%
if current_soc_percent < 50 and running_min_exceedance[i] != np.inf:
    conservation_activated[i] = True
    revised_target.iloc[i] = monthly_target + running_min_exceedance[i]
```

### Column Integration:
```python
# Add conservation columns to simulation dataframe
df_sim['Conserve_Activated'] = conservation_activated
df_sim['Battery Conserved kW'] = running_min_exceedance
df_sim['Revised_Target_kW'] = revised_target
```

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!
The Battery Conservation Mode feature is now fully implemented and operational in MD Shaving Solution V2. Users can enable it via the checkbox and see detailed results in both the metrics display and enhanced battery tables.
