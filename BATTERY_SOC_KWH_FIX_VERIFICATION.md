# Battery_SOC_kWh Initialization Fix - Verification

## ✅ Issue Resolved

You correctly identified that the `Battery_SOC_kWh` values themselves needed to be updated, not just the percentage calculations.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Discharge Path Initialization** (Line 5255)
```python
# OLD: 
current_soc_kwh = soc[i-1] if i > 0 else usable_capacity * 0.80

# NEW:
current_soc_kwh = soc[i-1] if i > 0 else battery_capacity * 0.95
```

### 2. **Charging Path Initialization** (Line 5297)  
```python
# OLD:
soc[i] = usable_capacity * 0.8

# NEW: 
soc[i] = battery_capacity * 0.95
```

## ✅ Result

Now both the **actual energy values** (`Battery_SOC_kWh`) and the **percentage values** (`Battery_SOC_Percent`) are correctly initialized and calculated:

- **Battery_SOC_kWh**: Starts at `battery_capacity * 0.95` (total capacity × 95%)
- **Battery_SOC_Percent**: Calculated as `(soc_kwh / battery_capacity) * 100`

This ensures that:
1. ✅ The battery starts with the correct amount of stored energy
2. ✅ The SOC percentage reflects the true state relative to total capacity
3. ✅ The "double limitation" issue is completely resolved
4. ✅ Safety constraints still protect the battery (5%-95% operational limits)

## Example Impact

For a 100 kWh battery with 85% DoD:
- **OLD**: Started with 68 kWh (80% of 85 kWh usable) 
- **NEW**: Starts with 95 kWh (95% of 100 kWh total)

This provides **27 kWh more initial energy** and removes the double application of DoD restrictions.
