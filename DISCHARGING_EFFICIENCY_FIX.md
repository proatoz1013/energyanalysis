# Energy Efficiency Discharging Calculation Fix

## Issue Identified
The discharging energy calculation in the enhanced battery table was incorrect, showing that the grid receives MORE energy than the battery discharges, which violates the laws of physics.

## Problem Analysis

### Incorrect Logic (Before Fix):
```python
# Grid energy delivered = Power × Time × Efficiency
grid_energy = power_kw * interval_hours * (efficiency_percent / 100)
```

**Example with 93% efficiency:**
- Battery discharges 100 kW for 0.5 hours = 50 kWh
- Grid receives: 50 × 0.93 = 46.5 kWh ✅ CORRECT PHYSICS
- **BUT** the code was showing this as the "energy delivered to grid"
- **PROBLEM**: We need to show how much the battery actually consumes internally

### Correct Logic (After Fix):
```python
# Battery energy consumed = Grid Power Required ÷ Efficiency
battery_energy_consumed = power_kw * interval_hours / (efficiency_percent / 100)
```

**Example with 93% efficiency:**
- Grid needs 100 kW for 0.5 hours = 50 kWh
- Battery must discharge internally: 50 ÷ 0.93 = 53.76 kWh
- Grid receives: 50 kWh (as requested)
- Battery loses: 3.76 kWh to efficiency losses

## Energy Flow Logic

### Charging (Correct - No Change Needed):
```
Grid → [Efficiency Loss] → Battery Storage
Grid provides: 53.76 kWh → Battery stores: 50 kWh (@ 93% efficiency)
Display: +53.76 (energy drawn from grid)
```

### Discharging (Fixed):
```
Battery Storage → [Efficiency Loss] → Grid
Battery discharges: 53.76 kWh → Grid receives: 50 kWh (@ 93% efficiency)
Display: -53.76 (energy consumed from battery)
```

## Column Meaning Clarification

The **"Charge (+ve)/Discharge (-ve) kWh"** column now correctly shows:

### ✅ **Charging (+ve values)**: 
- Energy drawn from the grid (including efficiency losses)
- Higher value because grid must provide extra energy to compensate for charging losses

### ✅ **Discharging (-ve values)**:
- Energy consumed from battery storage (including efficiency losses)  
- Higher value because battery must discharge extra energy to compensate for discharging losses

## Real-World Example

**Scenario**: 100 kW discharge for 30 minutes with 93% efficiency

### Before Fix (Incorrect):
- Display: `-46.50` kWh (suggesting only 46.5 kWh used from battery)
- **Problem**: This implies the battery storage only decreased by 46.5 kWh
- **Reality**: If only 46.5 kWh was discharged from battery, grid would only receive 43.25 kWh (46.5 × 0.93)

### After Fix (Correct):
- Display: `-53.76` kWh (battery storage consumed)
- **Correct**: Battery storage decreases by 53.76 kWh
- **Reality**: Grid receives 50 kWh (53.76 × 0.93 = 50)
- **Energy Balance**: 3.76 kWh lost to efficiency (53.76 - 50 = 3.76)

## Code Changes Made

**File**: `md_shaving_solution_v2.py`
**Lines**: 6517-6526 (discharging calculation section)

**Key Change**:
```python
# OLD (Incorrect):
grid_energy = power_kw * interval_hours * (efficiency_percent / 100)

# NEW (Correct):  
battery_energy_consumed = power_kw * interval_hours / (efficiency_percent / 100)
```

## Validation

### Energy Conservation Check:
- **Charging**: Grid energy ÷ efficiency = Battery energy stored ✅
- **Discharging**: Battery energy × efficiency = Grid energy delivered ✅

### Round-Trip Validation:
- Charge 50 kWh: Grid provides 53.76 kWh, battery stores 50 kWh
- Discharge 50 kWh: Battery uses 53.76 kWh, grid receives 50 kWh  
- **Net Loss**: 7.52 kWh over round-trip (53.76 + 53.76 - 50 - 50 = 7.52)
- **Expected Loss**: 50 kWh ÷ 0.93 - 50 kWh = 3.76 kWh each direction = 7.52 kWh total ✅

## Impact on Analysis

### 1. **More Accurate Energy Accounting**
