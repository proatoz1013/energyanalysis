# Energy Loss Column Addition - Complete

## Overview
Successfully added an "Energy Loss (kWh)" column to the enhanced battery table that shows the actual energy lost due to round-trip efficiency during charging and discharging operations.

## Implementation Details

### Column Position
- **Location**: Between "Charge (+ve)/Discharge (-ve) kWh" and "C Rate" columns
- **Column Number**: 8 (previous C Rate became column 9)
- **All subsequent columns renumbered accordingly**

### Calculation Logic

#### Energy Loss Formula:
```python
def calculate_energy_loss(power_kw):
    """Calculate energy loss due to round-trip efficiency"""
    if power_kw == 0:
        return "0.00"
    
    # Base energy without efficiency losses
    base_energy = abs(power_kw) * interval_hours
    
    if power_kw < 0:  # Charging
        # Energy loss = Grid energy required - Battery energy stored
        grid_energy = base_energy / (efficiency_percent / 100)
        energy_loss = grid_energy - base_energy
    else:  # Discharging  
        # Energy loss = Battery energy consumed - Grid energy delivered
        battery_energy = base_energy / (efficiency_percent / 100)
        energy_loss = battery_energy - base_energy
    
    return f"{energy_loss:.3f}"
```

### Real-World Examples

#### With 93% Efficiency (WEIHENG batteries):

**Charging 100 kW for 30 minutes:**
- Base energy: 50.00 kWh
- Grid energy required: 50 ÷ 0.93 = 53.76 kWh
- **Energy Loss**: 53.76 - 50.00 = **3.76 kWh**

**Discharging 100 kW for 30 minutes:**
- Base energy: 50.00 kWh 
- Battery energy consumed: 50 ÷ 0.93 = 53.76 kWh
- **Energy Loss**: 53.76 - 50.00 = **3.76 kWh**

### Key Features

#### 1. **Dynamic Efficiency Retrieval**
- Automatically pulls efficiency values from selected battery specifications
- Fallback to 95% default efficiency if battery not selected

#### 2. **Precision Display**
- Shows losses to 3 decimal places for accurate analysis
- Format: "3.760" kWh

#### 3. **Zero Loss Handling**
- Displays "0.00" when battery is in standby mode
- No energy loss when no power flow

#### 4. **Bidirectional Calculation**
- **Charging**: Loss = Extra grid energy needed above stored energy
- **Discharging**: Loss = Extra battery energy consumed above delivered energy

### Benefits for Analysis

#### 1. **Energy Efficiency Visibility**
- Users can now see exactly how much energy is lost to efficiency
- Helps understand true cost of battery operations

#### 2. **Financial Impact Assessment**
- Energy losses represent real cost in electricity bills
- 3.76 kWh loss per 50 kWh cycle adds up over time

#### 3. **Battery Technology Comparison**
- Different battery models with different efficiencies show different losses
- Enables informed decision-making for battery selection

#### 4. **Round-Trip Analysis**
- Full cycle analysis: charge loss + discharge loss = total round-trip loss
- Example: 3.76 + 3.76 = 7.52 kWh total loss per 50 kWh round-trip

### Technical Implementation

#### File Changes:
- **md_shaving_solution_v2.py**: Added `calculate_energy_loss()` function and column integration
- **Column Renumbering**: Updated all subsequent column numbers (9-29)

#### Function Integration:
- Seamlessly integrated with existing `calculate_energy_with_efficiency()` function
- Uses same efficiency retrieval mechanism
- Maintains consistency with interval_hours detection

### Validation Status

#### ✅ Completed:
- [x] Energy loss calculation function implemented

#### 📋 Expected Results:
- **Idle periods**: "0.00" (no energy loss)
- **93% efficiency charging**: Loss = power × time × 0.075 (7.5% loss)
- **93% efficiency discharging**: Loss = power × time × 0.075 (7.5% loss)
- **Round-trip total**: 15% energy loss (7.5% each direction)

## Conclusion

The "Energy Loss (kWh)" column provides essential visibility into the real energy costs of battery operations. This enhancement helps users understand the true efficiency impact of their battery energy storage systems and make more informed decisions about battery sizing, operation strategies, and technology selection.

Users can now see exactly how much energy is lost during each charging and discharging cycle, enabling better financial modeling and system optimization.
