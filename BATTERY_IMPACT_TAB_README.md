# Battery Impact Analysis Tab

## Overview
A new comprehensive battery impact analysis tab has been added to the Streamlit energy analysis application. This tab provides detailed analysis and visualization tools for battery energy storage systems.

## Files Created
- `battery_impact_tab.py` - Main implementation file for the Battery Impact Analysis tab

## Files Modified
- `streamlit_app.py` - Updated to include the new tab in the main application

## Features

### ðŸ”‹ Battery System Configuration
- **Battery Selection**: Choose from available battery models in the vendor database
- **Quantity Configuration**: Specify number of battery units
- **Specifications Display**: View detailed battery specifications

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Configuration
- **Power Requirements**: Set target power shaving (kW)
- **Energy Requirements**: Configure energy storage needs (kWh)
- **Duration Settings**: Define power duration and cycles per day

### ðŸ’° Financial Configuration
- **Cost Parameters**: Battery cost, PCS cost, installation multipliers
- **Savings Parameters**: MD rates, energy savings, analysis period
- **Customizable Rates**: Adjust financial parameters to match local conditions

### ðŸ“Š Performance Analysis
- **System Adequacy**: Power and energy adequacy assessment
- **Utilization Metrics**: System utilization percentages
- **Performance Visualization**: Charts showing requirements vs available capacity

### ðŸ’° Financial Analysis
- **Cost Breakdown**: Detailed investment cost analysis
- **Savings Projection**: Annual and cumulative savings calculations
- **Financial Metrics**: Payback period, NPV, ROI calculations
- **Investment Timeline**: Visual cash flow projections

### ðŸ“‹ Reporting
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of analysis results
- **Export Options**: CSV and text report generation
- **Investment Recommendations**: Automated investment guidance

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the Tab**: Select "âš¡ Battery Impact Analysis" from the main tab menu
2. **Select Battery**: Choose your preferred battery model and quantity
3. **Configure Targets**: Set your power and energy requirements
4. **Set Financial Parameters**: Configure costs and savings rates
5. **Review Analysis**: Examine performance and financial results
6. **Export Reports**: Generate detailed reports for decision making

## Integration

The new tab is fully integrated with the existing Streamlit application:
- Uses the same battery database (`vendor_battery_database.json`) as other tabs
- Follows the same UI/UX patterns as existing tabs
- Includes error handling and data validation
- Supports the same export and reporting capabilities

## Dependencies

The tab requires the following Python packages (already included in the main app):
- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- plotly
- json (built-in)
- datetime (built-in)

## Technical Details

### Key Functions
- `load_battery_database()` - Loads battery specifications from JSON
- `calculate_battery_metrics()` - Computes performance metrics
- `calculate_financial_metrics()` - Performs financial calculations
- `render_*()` functions - Handle UI rendering for different sections

### Data Flow
1. User selects battery and configures parameters
2. System calculates performance and financial metrics
3. Results are visualized through charts and tables
4. Reports can be exported for external use

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Battery degradation modeling over time
- Comparison between multiple battery options
- Integration with actual load profile data
- Advanced optimization algorithms
- Real-time cost data integration
