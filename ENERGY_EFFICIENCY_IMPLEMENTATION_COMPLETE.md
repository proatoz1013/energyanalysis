# Energy Efficiency Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented round-trip energy efficiency calculations in the V2 MD Shaving Solution's battery simulation. The system now applies realistic efficiency losses based on actual battery specifications from the vendor database.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Energy Efficiency Function Location
- **File**: `md_shaving_solution_v2.py`
- **Lines**: 6505-6530
- **Function**: `calculate_energy_with_efficiency(power_kw)`

### 2. Key Features Implemented

#### A. Dynamic Efficiency Retrieval
```python
# Get efficiency from selected battery specifications
efficiency_percent = 95.0  # Default efficiency
if hasattr(st.session_state, 'tabled_analysis_selected_battery'):
    battery_spec = st.session_state.tabled_analysis_selected_battery['spec']
    efficiency_percent = battery_spec.get('round_trip_efficiency', 95.0)
```

#### B. Charging Energy Calculation (Negative Power)
```python
# During charging: More energy from grid needed due to efficiency losses
# Grid energy required = Power Ã— Time Ã· Efficiency
grid_energy = abs(power_kw) * interval_hours / (efficiency_percent / 100)
return f"+{grid_energy:.2f}"
```

#### C. Discharging Energy Calculation (Positive Power)
```python
# During discharging: Energy delivered to grid after efficiency losses
# Grid energy delivered = Power Ã— Time Ã— Efficiency
grid_energy = power_kw * interval_hours * (efficiency_percent / 100)
return f"-{grid_energy:.2f}"
```

### 3. Battery Database Integration

#### Efficiency Values from Vendor Database:
- **WEIHENG Models**: 93.0% round-trip efficiency
  - TIANWU-50-233-0.25C: 93.0%
  - TIANWU-100-233-0.5C: 93.0%
  - TIANWU-250-233-1C: 93.0%
  - TIANWU-215-465-0.5C: 93.0%
  - TIANWU-465-465-1C: 93.0%
- **Fallback**: 95.0% default for batteries without specified efficiency

### 4. Enhanced Battery Table Column

#### Column: "Charge (+ve)/Discharge (-ve) kWh"
- **Purpose**: Shows realistic energy flow accounting for efficiency losses
- **Format**: 
  - Charging: `+XX.XX` (energy drawn from grid)
  - Discharging: `-XX.XX` (energy delivered to grid)
  - Idle: `0.00`

### 5. Real-World Impact Examples

#### With 93% Efficiency (WEIHENG batteries):
- **Charging 100 kW for 0.5 hours**:
  - Battery receives: 50 kWh
  - Grid energy required: 50 Ã· 0.93 = 53.76 kWh
  - Display: `+53.76`

- **Discharging 100 kW for 0.5 hours**:
  - Battery provides: 50 kWh
  - Grid energy delivered: 50 Ã— 0.93 = 46.50 kWh
  - Display: `-46.50`

### 6. System Integration

#### Session State Management:
- Battery specifications stored in `st.session_state.tabled_analysis_selected_battery`
- Automatic retrieval of efficiency values
- Graceful fallback to default values

#### Data Flow:
1. User selects battery from dropdown
2. Specifications loaded from `vendor_battery_database.json`
3. Efficiency value stored in session state
4. Enhanced table generation applies efficiency to power calculations
5. Realistic energy values displayed in charts and tables

4. **Financial Impact**: Confirm that energy costs reflect realistic efficiency losses

## Technical Notes

### Function Signature:
```python
def calculate_energy_with_efficiency(power_kw):
    """Calculate energy with round-trip efficiency from battery specifications"""
```

### Dependencies:
- `st.session_state.tabled_analysis_selected_battery['spec']`
- `interval_hours` from `_get_dynamic_interval_hours(df_sim)`
- Battery specifications from `vendor_battery_database.json`

### Error Handling:
- Graceful fallback to 95% efficiency if battery not selected
- Safe dictionary access with `.get()` methods
- Default values prevent calculation errors

## Conclusion
The energy efficiency implementation is now complete and fully integrated into the V2 MD Shaving Solution. The system provides realistic energy calculations that account for actual battery efficiency losses, enabling more accurate analysis and better decision-making for battery energy storage systems.
